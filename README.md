# spring-practice
This project is my first web app using the Java language, Spring framework, & Thymeleaf templating.

Created by Pablo Rosales

## Capabilities
This project as of right now creates a local server to handle the following two routes.

1. (/) The default route will message you a basic spring mvc error message.

2. (/capitalize/) This takes in anything after the last slash and will be returned to the user as a capitalized message on the page.

3. (/hello) This takes you to a static web page that returns a basic "Hello world!" web page. 

### Day 1: Implemented the framework to basic routes
* Made two RestControllers because I do not want templeting for the most basic pages, they are fine being implementing this way.

### Day 2:
