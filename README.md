# spring-practice
This project is my first web app using the Java language, Spring framework, & Thymeleaf templating.

Created by Pablo Rosales

## Capabilities
This project as of right now creates a local server to handle the following two routes.

1. ("/") The default route will message you a"basic "Hello World!" greeting.

2. ("/capitalize") This requests a query parameter which will be returned to the user as a capitalized message.
